<h1>QuaZIP</h1>

<p>QuaZIP is the C++ wrapper for Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package
(AKA minizip) using the Qt framework.</p>

<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>zlib</li>
    <li>Qt 5</li>
</ol>

<h3>Building:</h3>

Building QuaZIP is super simple. Just open the terminal on your Mac/Linux
or Command Prompt on Windows and type the following:
```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=(Debug|Release) -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/QuaZIP
```
<h5>Notes for building on Windows:</h5>
We recommend you not to install QuaZIP in "Program Files" on Windows. We also recommend to use
the NMake Makefiles generator if you are compiling with Visual Studio.

<h3>Documentation:</h3>

<p>See doc/html or, if you do not have a browser, quazip/*.h and
